# Edgar Allan Poe Styled Website  

## Overview  
This project is a **mini website** dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe, featuring a **homepage** and two of his works:  
- *The Tell-Tale Heart* (short story)  
- *Lenore* (poem)  

### **Hosted Website:**  
[View the website here](https://spmadar.github.io/module4/index.html)

I renamed poe.html to index.html because GitHub Pages requires an index.html file as the default landing page. Without this change, visitors would have to manually enter the full file name in the URL instead of the site loading automatically.

## Assignment Requirements  
The goal was to **edit and enhance** the given style sheet without modifying the HTML structure unless necessary. The following requirements were met:  

- **One background image** applied (for the entire page and individual poems)  
- **Two background colors** used in different sections  
- **Three additional CSS styles** added:
  - Custom fonts for headings and paragraphs  
  - Hover effects for links  
  - Box shadows for elements  
- **At least two CSS comments** included for clarity  
- **Ensured valid and accessible code** using validators  

## **Enhancements & Updates**  
### **Background & Layout Improvements**  
- **Homepage:** Now features a **crow-themed** background with a transparent overlay for a haunting effect.
- **Lenore Page:** Includes a **light, eerie-themed** background to match the poemâ€™s tone.
- **Tell-Tale Heart Page:** Dark **heart-themed** background with an ominous gradient overlay.

### **Typography & Readability**  
- **Gothic Fonts Applied:**
  - Headings use `Almendra SC`, `Lora`, and `Libre Baskerville` for a classic literary feel.
  - Body text uses `EB Garamond` with **increased line-height and spacing** for readability.
- **Paragraphs Styled:**
  - Background adjusted to a **light semi-transparent** box for contrast.
  - Maximum width constraints added for better formatting.

### **Interactive & Visual Enhancements**  
- **Hover Effects for Links:**
  - Links in **Tell-Tale Heart & Lenore** scale up and glow red on hover.
  - Navigation links subtly brighten when hovered.
- **Tables & Content Boxes Styled:**
  - **Tables now have rounded corners, improved contrast, and a shadow effect.**
  - **Boxed content areas** (like paragraphs) have a **semi-transparent white background** for a readable aesthetic.

This update maintains the assignment requirements while refining the aesthetic and readability of the site.
